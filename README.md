Business solutiont he project was trying to solve:

Problem: There is a lot of chaos surrounding choosing a major and 
getting an actual plan for semesters up to graduation. To add to that, 
finding a good class schedule and making a new plan based off future 
problems is tough.

Solution: A graduation planner for all majors that adapts to classes 
taken and students schedules. The planner also helps filter class times 
based off the students busy schedule (work, etc.). It even finds 
intersecting classes to help find a generic plan for students unsure 
of a specific degree.
